GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you’d like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today we'd like to say a special thanks to Ed Kerry on his last day working for GOV.UK. Ed's been
writing software for GOV.UK since 2018, and has helped steer the ship through some major events.

He helped make sure GOV.UK was scalable enough to handle the biggest waves of traffic, and contributed
massively to the way GOV.UK works behind the scenes. He's one of our top experts in the Smart Answers
format which powers complex question flows.

We thank Ed the most for the warm enthusiasm he brought towards helping people. He’s someone you can count
on to jump into a challenge and provide friendly assistance that will always add value. We know that anyone
joining Ed on a piece of work is going to be welcomed and given ample support to make a difference.

Thank you for your service Ed and wish you all the best for the future!
