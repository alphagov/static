GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you'd like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today we're saying goodbye to Bevan Loon, one of our Lead Developers. Bevan
joined GOV.UK in 2016 and has been chipping away behind the scenes ever since.

Over the years Bevan's worked on many things - the consolidation of content to a
single GOV.UK Content Store, delivering a bespoke email notification system,
leading efforts to improve the health of the platform and advocating for good
pair programming practices.

Bevan's been a core pillar of the developer community, teaching us all how to be
better developers and better people. Almost single handedly running the GOV.UK
Tech Fortnightly meeting.

Bevan - thank you so much for all the work you've done and all the support
you've given us. Good luck, we'll miss you!
