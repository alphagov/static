GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If youâ€™d like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today we say a fond farewell to Tim Leighton-Boyce, a pillar of the GOV.UK Performance Analyst
community. Tim leaves after a marathon shift as Senior and then Lead PA. Some say that only an
analyst of his calibre could measure a time period that long without encountering rounding
issues.

In his early days Tim was an advocate of A/B testing on GOV.UK and taught many of us more about
statistical significance than we thought we needed to know. More recently, he's been unpicking
the complexity of updating our analytics software, which is no mean feat. Tim's worked on many
of our most important products over the years, and has been a crucial part of making GOV.UK
better.

Tim's been an absolute pleasure to work with. His calm, quiet, excellence and friendly smile
will be impossible to replace. Good luck skating off into retirement, we'll miss you!
