GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you'd like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Jen Allum is in charge of all of this. This thing you’re reading and the repository it sits in, the people who maintain it and the people who decide what it should do. Jen’s the one who makes it possible for all of that to happen. And she’s leaving us. She’ll be our X-boss. 

Jen joined GDS in September 2015 and became head of GOV.UK in 2018. Since that time she has led GOV.UK through Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic, with a laser-like focus on helping users understand what they need to do in these complex situations. And she has given us a powerful vision of what GOV.UK will become in the future.

Jen was attracted to GOV.UK because of the way we work and write about that work. It might not seem like much, but it’s a really big deal to be able to do that in government, and it’s something that Jen has made sure we’re still able to do. 

She’s open, friendly, and universally liked by those of us who help to look after GOV.UK (and just everyone in general). Thank you, Jen, for all you’ve done for GOV.UK, for government, and for the people who live and work in the UK.
