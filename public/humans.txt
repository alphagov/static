GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you’d like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today is Design Legend Kate Ivey-Williams’ last day at GDS.

Kate has made an incredible contribution since joining in 2015 as one of the first service designers
on GOV.UK. She was the brains behind the step by step navigation format, which guides users through
complex tasks. Step by step navigation won a D&AD Pencil Award in 2019 and has been copied by organisations
around the world. She has also played a key role in countless other major GOV.UK projects, including
helping users prepare for Brexit and creating gov.uk/coronavirus.

Kate has been a tireless champion of the value of service design for government, as well as being honest,
kind and giving amazing support to individuals. She will be missed very much by colleagues at GOV.UK and
in the design community in GDS and across government. 

Thank you Kate!
