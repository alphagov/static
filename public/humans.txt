GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If youâ€™d like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today we say bye to Ian James, Lead Frontend Developer on GOV.UK, after 4 years and 3 months at GDS. He is an integral part of the Frontend Community at GDS and in every team he's worked with he's done a stellar job in trying to convince them that building an accessible service was important for all users!

Thank you Ian. You will be missed!
