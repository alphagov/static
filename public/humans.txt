GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If youâ€™d like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Chris Banks is leaving us today. Since joining GDS' Site Reliability Engineering community in 2019, Chris
has seen GOV.UK through some tumultuous times. He's helped to keep GOV.UK reliable and (mostly) free of
incidents, while at the same time leading GOV.UK's largest software infrastructure project - rebuilding
the foundations that GOV.UK runs on.

Throughout Chris' time working on GOV.UK he's had a relentless focus on eliminating waste, both in terms of
cloud spend and engineering processes. Combined with his incredible attention to detail and desire to build
things the right way, he's ensured that GOV.UK's new infrastructure is built to stand the test of time. Chris
and his team's work on modernising GOV.UK's infrastructure is a story that GDS is truly proud of.

Chris also worked on the COVID team, one of the most demanding and challenging programmes GDS has ever undertaken.
Chris was famous for running head first into the technical fires as the first responder, triaging and solving
many problems that had a huge real world impact on people's lives.

Chris has taught us all so much about computers, networking, and how to handle the shock and horror of
discovering how a bit of technology actually works.

Good luck Chris - thank you for your immense contributions to GOV.UK. We'll miss you.
