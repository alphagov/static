GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you'd like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Bill leaves today. We’re sad about this because he’s a wonderful human being who also happens to be a really great technologist.

Every team Bill’s joined has benefitted from his presence. His enthusiasm and outstanding technical ability inspire others to do better. His kindness and warmth demonstrate the behaviour we wish to see, inspiring others in these valuable virtues too.

He’s made significant contributions to improving GOV.UK’s search and built vital services to help vulnerable people during the pandemic. Bill has recently been helping rebuild the infrastructure that GOV.UK relies upon, being instrumental in driving that project forward to success.  We’re going to miss the hole that he leaves.

Good luck Bill, and thank you for all that you’ve done, you will be sorely missed.
