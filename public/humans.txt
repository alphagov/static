GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If youâ€™d like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today GOV.UK bids a fond farewell to Rosa Fox - one of its Senior Developers. Rosa joined in 2016,
and has been a huge part of GDS and GOV.UK's culture over the last 8 years. From small things to
make the office more fun on Fridays, all the way through to chairing the Women's network and
(literally) flying the Suffragette flag for GDS, Rosa has been a huge influence on the organisation.

She's also an exceptional software engineer, and someone who GOV.UK has relied on in times of crisis.
During the Covid-19 lockdowns, she was the technical lead of GOV.UK's coronavirus team - calm under
pressure and pragmatic with technical decisions, she made sure the team felt safe as it worked to
keep others safe.

Thank you Rosa for everything you've done at GDS - we'll miss you!
