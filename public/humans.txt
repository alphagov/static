GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you'd like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today we're saying goodbye to Stephen Ford, one of our Senior Site Reliability
Engineers. Stephen has worked at GDS since 2015 and during his time with us
has been instrumental in keeping GOV.UK available and secure. He's also a great
human being, and has been a positive and supportive influence on so many of us.

Thank you Stephen for all the work you've done and all the support
you've given us. Good luck, we'll miss you!
