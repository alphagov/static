GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you'd like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

We don't often have cause to edit GOV.UK's humans.txt file, but the departure of our lead content designer, Jon Sanger, is a very good one.

Few people have done more than Jon to set the high standard of content on GOV.UK we all reach for. 

For the last ~9 years, he's been that mast in the storm. Above all else, he makes sure the public are able to understand how to interact with the government when they need to, simply and clearly. 

He has a habit of picking the hard work, to make things simpler for our users. He's resolved countless difficult situations, shielded countless team members, and has been a great friend to us countless times.

Most recently, Jon's taken on the considerable responsibility of heading up the Brexit content team, where his focus on the user has been as relentless as ever. Jon's empathetic leadership has made the team a genuine pleasure to work on, despite the tricky circumstances we're all dealing with this year.
We really can't thank him enough for that, or for everything else he's given to his colleagues and to the public while at GDS.
