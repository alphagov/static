Today we say goodbye to Dilwoar Hussain who is leaving GDS after five and a half years.

Dilwoar has brought his entrepreneurial spirit to GDS and we’ve benefited greatly. He’s been a
keen advocate of utilising technology to make things easier for users and how to embrace
technological advances for more efficient software development.

He’s also been a keen contributor to GDS communities, which many of us have benefitted from. His
contributions have ranged from making GDS more inclusive to fellow Muslims, to supporting the
career progression of Frontend Developers.

Thank you Dilwoar and all the best for the future.
