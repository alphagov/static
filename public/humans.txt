GOV.UK is built by a team at the Government Digital Service (with thanks to Martha!) in London,
Bristol and Manchester.  If you’d like to join us, see https://gdscareers.gov.uk/

Today we say goodbye to Ben Thorner. Ben has worked in GDS as a software engineer since 2018 and has made a substantial impact improving GOV.UK’s tooling and development practices.

We have many contributions to thank Ben for. He has helped deliver key government priorities. He has created communities to help improve developer experience and tooling. He has tirelessly facilitated opinionated discussions with many stakeholders to lead to fruitful results. He has created and iterated tooling that all GOV.UK software developers benefit from each day.

However, we’re most grateful for his personal contributions to our community: his ability to share information he has learnt, his willingness to collaborate and his unwavering enthusiasm that things can be better and it’s within our reach to make them so.

Thank you Ben, you inspire us all to do more.
