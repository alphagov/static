# Slimmer Templates

## `gem_layout` (default)

This template uses the [public layout component] from the GOV.UK Publishing Components gem. It supplies the header and footer only - this includes the cookie banner, skip to content link, header bar, emergency banner, survey banner, global bar, feedback, and footer. The content is constrained and centred.

## `gem_layout_full_width`

This is the same as the `gem_layout` template, except that this layout **doesn't** constrain and centre the content to the same width as the GOV.UK header.

Use this layout if you want to have full width content - such as the blue welcome bar on the GOV.UK homepage.
