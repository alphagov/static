/*

  File:
  admin-bootstrap-example.css

  Purpose:
  This is an example stylesheet to copy and paste into any new admin apps we 
  build.

  This file is for Rails 3 admin apps that use the asset pipeline, rather than 
  ones that are being Slimmed and serving assets through Static.

  Create your app, include the Twitter Bootstrap and formtastic-bootstrap 
  assets, then copy the base styles below into the 
  'app/assets/stylesheets/application.css' file. 

  Only the 'body' and '.navbar .brand' styles are required. Any other changes
  can be included below those where needed. The 'body' styles are overridden
  here to make sure that the space for the navbar is included.

  Currently the only overrides to Bootstrap to GDS-ify the apps are including 
  the crown image and setting the brand type to Gill Sans. This may change in 
  future.
