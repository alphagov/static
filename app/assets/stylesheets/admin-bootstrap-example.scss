/*
 *
 * File:
 * admin-bootstrap-example.css
 *
 * Purpose:
 * This is an example stylesheet to copy and paste into any new admin apps we
 * build.
 *
 * This file is for Rails 3 admin apps that use the asset pipeline, rather than
 * ones that are being Slimmed and serving assets through Static.
 *
 * Create your app, include the Twitter Bootstrap and formtastic-bootstrap
 * assets, then copy the base styles below into the
 * 'app/assets/stylesheets/application.css' file.
 *
 * Only the 'body' and '.navbar .brand' styles are required. Any other changes
 * can be included below those where needed. The 'body' styles are overridden
 * here to make sure that the space for the navbar is included.
 *
 * Currently the only overrides to Bootstrap to GDS-ify the apps are including
 * the crown image and setting the brand type to Gill Sans. This may change in
 * future.
