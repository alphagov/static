  Currently this just takes a content-store links hash like object which it
  can then turn into the correct analytics identifier metadata tags.

  The code which reads the meta tags can be found <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/static/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/analytics/static-analytics.js#L76-L96">in static-analytics.js</a>.
