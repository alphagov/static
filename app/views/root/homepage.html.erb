 # There is a requirement to add the thank you comment in a place which is
 # obvious. Rendering file with the govuk_template lets us put the comment
 # after the govuk_template. govuk_template as it stands doesn't have a
 # content_for which could otherwise be used.

 # This is only wanted for the homepage and can't be put in to the frontend
 # template on frontend due to the way slimmer would not copy over the
 # comment
